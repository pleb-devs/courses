# Welcome to PlebDevs Starter Course

## Course Mission
Welcome to the PlebDevs starter course! I'm Austin, the founder of PlebDevs, and I'll be walking you through this short intro starter course that will get you up and running and interacting with the rest of the content on the platform. If you're here, I'm assuming you're new to coding or just starting out. If you already have experience and have your bearings down, there's lots more intermediate and advanced content on the platform. This course is designed for absolute beginners.

## Course Goals

### Overall PlebDevs Goals
1. Learn how to code
2. Build Bitcoin/Lightning/Nostr apps 
3. Become a developer

This is a big journey with a lot of pieces and things to learn. The starter course is going to get you on that path as quickly as possible and make it a smooth journey.

### Starter Course Objectives
1. Give you an easy, high-level overview of the dev journey
2. Get you set up and comfortable in a development environment where you'll write and ship code
3. Give you basic experience in the languages covered in our courses and workshops

There's lots of material out there that will just tell you exactly what to do and not explain why but I want you to actually understand for yourself. I want you to have a good mental model of what this journey is going to be like, what it's going to be like actually writing and pushing code. And then we're going to start getting our hands dirty and gain real experience.

## What is a PlebDev?

### Origins and Philosophy
I started using the term "PlebDev" a few years ago to describe a unique approach to learning development in the Bitcoin space. It represents:

- **Inclusive Learning**: Anyone can become a developer, regardless of background
- **Growth Mindset**: Embracing the journey from beginner to professional
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasizing real-world application development
- **Community Support**: Learning and growing together

### Key Characteristics
- üå± **Growth-Focused**: PlebDevs are always learning and improving
- üéØ **App-Centric**: Focus on building applications rather than protocol development
- üÜï **Embrace Being New**: Being a new developer is infinitely better than being on the sidelines
- ü§ù **Community-Driven**: Bitcoin/Lightning/Nostr ecosystem needs more plebdevs like you!

## Our Learning Approach

### Core Principles
1. **Lower Barriers**
   - Simplify complex concepts
   - Focus on practical understanding
   - Build confidence through action

2. **Project-Based Learning**
   - Learn by doing
   - Create real applications
   - Build a portfolio as you learn

3. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Focus**
   - Start with core functionality
   - Get things working first
   - Iterate and improve

4. **Actionable Knowledge**
   - Focus on the 20% that delivers 80% of results
   - Learn what you can use right away
   - Build practical skills

### Teaching Methods
- Detailed concept breakdowns
- Line-by-line code explanations
- Interactive learning
- 1:1 support available
- Community-driven progress

## Course Structure

### The Learning Path
Instead of the traditional bottom-up approach, we use a project-focused method:
```
    üèîÔ∏è Advanced Skills
   üèîÔ∏è Projects & Practice
  üèîÔ∏è Core Concepts
 üèîÔ∏è Development Environment
üèîÔ∏è Getting Started
```

We'll create checkpoints through projects, allowing you to:
- Verify your understanding
- Build your portfolio
- See real progress
- Have reference points for review

## Student Expectations

### What We Expect From You
- **High Agency**: Take ownership of your learning journey
- **Active Participation**: Engage with the material and community
- **Persistence**: Push through challenges
- **Curiosity**: Ask questions and explore concepts

### What You Can Expect From Us
- Clear, practical instruction
- Comprehensive support
- Real-world applications
- Community backing

## Getting Started

### Next Steps
1. Ensure you're ready to commit to learning
2. Set up your development environment (next lesson)
3. Join our community
4. Start building!

## Resources and Support

### Where to Get Help

### Tips for Success
1. Push code daily, even if it is small.
2. Focus on understanding rather than memorizing.
3. Build projects that interest you.
4. Engage with the community.
5. Don't be afraid to ask questions.

## Remember
You don't need to become a "10x developer" overnight. The goal is to start writing code, build useful things, and gradually improve. Every expert was once a beginner, and the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single line of code.
