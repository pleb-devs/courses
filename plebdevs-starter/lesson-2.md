# Setting Up Your Code Editor

## Introduction
In this lesson, we'll set up the most fundamental tool in your development journey: your code editor. This is where you'll spend most of your time writing, testing, and debugging code, so it's crucial to get comfortable with it from the start.

## What is an IDE?

### Definition
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. Think of it as your complete workshop for writing code.

### Key Components
1. **Code Editor**
   - Where you write and edit code
   - Provides syntax highlighting
   - Helps with code formatting
   - Makes code easier to read and write

2. **Compiler/Interpreter**
   - Runs your code
   - Translates your code into executable instructions
   - Helps test your applications

3. **Debugging Tools**
   - Help find and fix errors
   - Provide error messages and suggestions
   - Make problem-solving easier

## Setting Up Visual Studio Code

### Why VS Code?

  cd      # Change directory
  clear   # Clear terminal
  code .  # Open VS Code in current directory
  ```

#### 3. Essential Extensions
Install these extensions to enhance your development experience:
1. **ESLint**
   - Helps find and fix code problems
   - Enforces coding standards
   - Improves code quality

2. **Prettier**
   - Automatically formats your code
   - Maintains consistent style
   - Saves time on formatting

3. **Live Server**
   - Runs your web pages locally
   - Auto-refreshes on save
   - Great for web development

### Important Keyboard Shortcuts

```

## Writing Your First Code
Let's create and run a simple HTML file:

1. Create a new file (`index.html`)
2. Add basic HTML content:
   ```html
   <h1>Hello World!</h1>
   ```
3. Save the file (Ctrl/Cmd + S)
4. Open in browser or use Live Server

## Best Practices

- Save frequently (Ctrl/Cmd + S)
- Watch for the unsaved dot indicator
- Enable auto-save if preferred

### 3. Terminal Usage
- Get comfortable with basic commands
- Use the integrated terminal
- Practice navigation and file operations

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Installation Problems
- Ensure you have admin rights
- Check system requirements
- Use official download sources

### 2. Extension Issues
- Keep extensions updated
- Disable conflicting extensions
- Restart VS Code after installation

### 3. Performance
- Don't install too many extensions
- Regular restart of VS Code
- Keep your system updated

## Next Steps

1. **Practice Navigation**
   - Create and manage files
   - Use the integrated terminal
   - Try keyboard shortcuts

2. **Customize Your Editor**
   - Explore themes
   - Adjust font size
   - Configure auto-save

3. **Prepare for Next Lesson**
   - Keep VS Code open
